# Weekly task 3: Python code to reverse string


s = "The quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog."


# print(len(s))
# s lenght = 43

s1 = s[43:22:-2]
s2 = s[23:18:-2]
s3 = s[17:0:-2]

print(s1, s2, s3)

# Not very happy with the way i found out the solution,
# I have counted the spaces one by one many many times
# I am sure there is a more automated way to solve this
# and hopefully I will find it out soon :).
